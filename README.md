                    <h3>The life of Jadav Molai Payeng</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Jadav Molai Payeng was born in 1963 in a small village in Assam, India. He belongs to
                            the indigenous
                            Mishing tribe of Assam.
                        </li>

                        <li>As a child, he lived near the Brahmaputra River, which influenced his love for nature.He
                            saw the effects
                            of deforestation and soil erosion from a very young age.</li>

                        <li>In 1979, when he was just 16 years old, he saw many dead snakes on a sandbar due to
                            extreme heat.</li>

                        <li>That incident made him very sad and pushed him to take action to save the environment.
                            He decided to
                            plant trees on the barren sandbar to protect animals and the land.</li>

                        <li>He started planting bamboo seedlings with his own hands without any outside help and
                            continued planting
                            trees every day for several years, all by himself.</li>

                        <li>Over time, the trees grew into a huge forest called Molai Forest.</li>

                        <li>Today, Molai Forest is over 1,360 acres (more than 1000 football fields) in size. The
                            forest is home to
                            many animals like elephants, deer, birds, monkeys, and even tigers.</li>

                        <li>Jadav Payeng protected the forest from woodcutters and poachers all by himself. He
                            became known as the <strong>“Forest Man of India”</strong> for his hard work and dedication.
                        </li>

                        <li>He never asked for any money or reward while creating the forest.</li>

                        <li>In 2015, the Indian Government honored him with the Padma Shri, a civilian award. He has
                            also received
                            many awards and honors from universities and organizations around the world.</li>

                        <li>He was invited by the United Nations to speak about environmental protection. A short
                            film called <strong>"Forest Man"</strong> was made about his life and won several awards.
                        </li>

                        <li>He still lives a simple life with his wife and three children near the forest. He
                            continues to plant
                            trees every day even today. He believes that if one person can destroy nature, one
                            person can also
                            protect it.

                        </li>

                        <li>His forest has helped control floods and erosion in the nearby areas. His efforts also
                            improved the
                            local climate and increased rainfall in that area.</li>

                        <li>He teaches people to plant trees and love nature, especially the younger generation.
                        </li>

                        <li>Many students, journalists, and environmentalists visit him to learn from his work. He
                            never went to
                            college, but universities gave him an <strong>honorary doctorate</strong> for his
                            contribution. He has
                            shown that even
                            one person can bring a big change in the world.</li>

                        <li> His work inspires millions of people around the globe to protect the environment. Jadav
                            Payeng is a
                            living example of how love, patience, and hard work can change the world.</li>
